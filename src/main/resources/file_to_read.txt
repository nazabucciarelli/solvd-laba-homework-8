A framework is an open-source software platform that provides support for code
 libraries and scripting languages that developers can use when building
 websites and applications. In other words, it makes core programming easy.
 Spring is a lightweight framework that offers an elaborate environment for
 robust programming and configuration model for Java-based applications.
 Spring Boot is a java-based framework that is best for creating stand-alone,
  Spring-based applications in a short period. Both Spring and Spring Boot
  are used for developing web applications in Java. There is, however,
  a significant difference between Spring vs Spring Boot.
